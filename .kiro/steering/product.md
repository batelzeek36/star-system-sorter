# Product Overview

**Star System Sorter (S³)** is a hybrid mobile application that combines React Native UI with an embedded Flutter/Flame game (Super Dash). The app provides a deterministic personality classification system based on Human Design principles, mapping users to "star systems" (e.g., Pleiades, Sirius) through weighted scoring.

## Core Features

- **Personality Classification**: Deterministic star system classification from Human Design chart data
- **Team-Based Gaming**: Async competitive gameplay with Super Dash platformer
- **Comprehensive Moderation**: Safety-first approach across all user-generated content
- **Server Validation**: Statistical validation and leaderboards with fair team scoring

## Key Principles

- **Determinism**: PCG32 RNG, fixed timestep, reproducible scoring
- **Safety-first**: Hard blocks for harmful content, soft blocks for policy violations
- **Native-first**: React Native UI with Flutter native modules
- **Modularity**: Small, focused files with clear boundaries

## Terminology

- Use "star system" (never "house") for classification systems
- App name: "Star System Sorter" or "S³"

## Scope (MVP Non-Goals)

- No authentication, payments, push notifications, or analytics/telemetry
- No real-time multiplayer (async only), no web/iframe client
